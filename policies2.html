                <p>Zoomcar Host Services is a marketplace feature of the Platform more particularly described below.
                    that helps
                    owners of vehicles (“Hosts”/ “Lessors”) connect with users in temporary need of a vehicle on
                    leasehold basis
                    (“Lessee”) for their personal use (“Zoomcar Host Services”). Zoomcar does not itself lease or deal
                    with such
                    vehicles in any manner whatsoever and only provides a service connecting the Hosts to the Lessees so
                    they
                    may enter into a Lease Agreement (defined below). You understand and agree that Zoomcar is not a

                    vehicle,
                    nor is Zoomcar a transportation service, agent, or insurer. Zoomcar has no control over the conduct
                    of the
                    Users of the Zoomcar Host Services and disclaims all liability in this regard.</p><br>

                    Lessees.
                    Although Zoomcar Host Services provides support for the transaction between Hosts and Lessees, we do
                    not
                    guarantee the quality or safety of the vehicles listed on the Platform, nor can we guarantee the
                    truth or
                    accuracy of any listings, or whether Hosts and Lessees will consummate a transaction, including the
                    completion of any payment obligations.s</p><br>
